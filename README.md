## Project Description

This capstone project for COMPSCI 399 at the University of Auckland leverages OpenAI's creative capabilities to craft interactive stories. The project prompts large language models (LLMs) to generate scenes, choices, storylines, and characters while keeping track of crucial story details. The result is a consistent, endlessly evolving interactive narrative where no two playthroughs are the same.

## Motivation

The advent of LLMs has opened up new avenues for creating unique and engaging stories. By using these models, we can generate content that surpasses the limits of traditional human storytelling. However, while popular LLMs excel at generating ideas, they often lack the consistency required to be effective storytellers on their own. Our project addresses this by delegating the task of maintaining narrative coherence to our software, ensuring a seamless and cohesive story experience.

We aim to deliver an authentic storytelling experience, emphasizing consistency and narrative cohesion. Additionally, our project explores innovative approaches to integrating LLMs with our software at a granular level. Currently, we prompt OpenAI to return much of its story data in JSON format, allowing for greater control and flexibility in story creation.

## Installation

To install the project requirements, run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To start the program, simply execute:

```python main.py```

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model
- PyLint for linting
- PyTest for unit testing

## Current Features

- A dynamic, ever-changing storyteller program is rapidly taking shape!

## Future Plan

The future plan for this project would be to implement a GUI, making the experience more interactive and enjoyable, which is one of the purposes of this project.
